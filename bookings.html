				<h2 class="color--ob">About Online Booking</h2>
				<p>Online Booking is an appointment booking website used by (mainly) hair salons and beauty spas. It's add-on feature for Kitomba customers, and is the main area where Kitomba's <em>client's</em> clients interact directly with a Kitomba systems. It therefore has a much wider reach than the main Kitomba system used by stylists/receptionists/etc.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="ob--result">
				<h2 class="color--ob">How good is it?</h2>
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>At launch, bookings up by 25% overnight</li>
					<li>Handles nearly $2m in bookings every week</li>
				</ul>

		<div class="ob--involvement">
			<h2 class="color--ob">What I did</h2>
			<p>The old booking system stunk, so I yada yada</p>
			<ul class="bullets">
				<li>I <strong>convinced</strong> the folks at Kitomba that the old booking system needed a complete overhaul. <!-- The old system sucked for many reasons, but the biggest issues were that it had a login/signup wall at the start and it was extremely mobile-unfriendly. At the time the site had 30% of sessions on mobile, this is up to 60% today. --><br />
				In a company like Kitomba where building new features is always prioritised over improving (or removing) existing ones, this in itself was quite an achievement.</li>
				<li>I was able to do said convincing with the help of <strong>data</strong>, and by building <strong>prototypes</strong> illustrating how much better the system could be.</li>
				<li>I <strong>tested</strong> the ideas on colleagues and unsuspecting people on other floors of our building, throughout the project. This was a mix of paper prototyping and user testing.</li>
				<li>I worked closely with the devs as they backbone-ised it and hooked up a backend. And I ensured they got it working in a <em>nice</em> way</li>
				<li>I also designed and built the customisation area where each business can choose styles and settings.</li>
